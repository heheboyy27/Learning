There are many types of Primitive Variables, but the four that are supported by Java are:
1. byte - 8 bits, from -128 to 127
2. short - 16 bits, from -32,000 to 32000
3. int - 32 bits, from -2.1 billion to 2.1 billion
4. long - 64 bits, from -9.2 quintillion, to 9.2 quintillion

There are other types as well, such as:
5. float - numbers that have decimal values, with the same constraints as int
6. double - like float, but with the constrains of long

One thing to note about float and double is that you can have a float value as a double, but once a value is set to a double, it cannot be set back to a float.

7. char - while the other primitive variable types are used to store numbers, the char variable type is used to set a letter.
8. boolean - used to set a true or false value. (must use lowercase true and lowercase false)
