- 1. Evolution of Unicode
  - Unicode was created to solve the problem of multiple incompatible character encoding systems.
  - Early encodings (like ASCII) supported only limited characters (mainly English).
  - Unicode began in 1991, aiming to include all characters from every writing system.
  - Over time, Unicode expanded from 16-bit (65,536 characters) to over 1.1 million code points.
  - Unicode now supports modern scripts, historical scripts, emojis, and symbols.
  - It ensures consistent text representation across platforms and languages.

- 2. Typing Different Languages on an English Keyboard
  - Input Method Editors (IMEs) or keyboard layouts allow typing in different languages.
  - Example: Typing "a" on an English keyboard can output "ا" (Arabic) if the Arabic layout is enabled.
  - The keyboard sends key codes, and the operating system maps them to the selected language's characters.
  - Virtual keyboards and software (like Google Input Tools) also allow multilingual typing.

- 3. Keyword in Java
  - A keyword in Java is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning in the language.
  - Keywords cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, class names, or methods).
  - Examples: `class`, `public`, `static`, `void`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `return`.
  - Java has 67 reserved keywords.

- 4. MSB and LSB
  - MSB (Most Significant Bit)**: The left-most bit in a binary number. It carries the highest value.
    - Example: In `1001`, MSB is `1`.
  - LSB (Least Significant Bit)**: The right-most bit in a binary number. It carries the lowest value.
    - Example: In `1001`, LSB is `1`.
  - MSB is often used to indicate the sign in signed binary numbers.

- 5. Default Values of Primitive Variables in Java
  - `byte` → `0`
  - `short` → `0`
  - `int` → `0`
  - `long` → `0L`
  - `float` → `0.0f`
  - `double` → `0.0d`
  - `char` → `'\u0000'` (null character)
  - `boolean` → `false`
