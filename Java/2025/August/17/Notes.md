1. The way that Java works on different OS is that when a .java file is compiled, it doesn't save on a program specific format, but is stored and saved in a format called bytecode. Bytecode is stored as a .class file and is usually considered platform-independant. This means that it is always read the same, regardless of the system or OS.
JDK, or the Java Development Kit, is a software development environment, used for creating Java applications and applets. It includes a lot of tools like a compiler, a debugger, and a JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
The JRE, or the Java Runtime Environment, is a software layer that allows Java to be run on a computer. It includes more internal components like the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), class libraries, and other components that allow Java applications to excecute.
Bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of source code. It is usually made for quick and fast excecution by a virtual machine or an interpretator. It is used so that code can be read and utilised on different platforms without having to be recompiled or edited.
Java was first pioneered in the early 1990's by James Gosling, under a project named Oak. In 1995, Java 1.0 was released, and provided users with 'Write once, run anywhere' with free runtimes. In 1997, Sun attempted to formalize Java, but they withdrew, and ended up making Java implementations free of charge. In 2006, Sun launched Java as a free, open-source software, and completed their process in 2007 by releasing a fully accessible version, except for a non-copyrighted portion of the code.
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to help developers store, manage, and collaborate on their software projects. It provides a space for developers to store their code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects, making it a central hub for software development and open-source collaboration.
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, acting as an interface between the user and the computer. It provides a platform for running applications and managing tasks, ensuring smooth operation of the computer system.
A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software program that acts as a runtime environment for Java applications. It allows Java code to run on different operating systems without needing to be recompiled for each one.
There are many key areas where Java can be used:                                                                              -Mobile Applications: Android app development.                                                                                -Web Applications: Side server components, web services, and dynamic content for websites.                                    -Desktop applications: Cross-platform software with GUI's like Swing and JavaFX.                                              -etc. 
While Java is an object-based programming language, JavaScript is an OOP(object-oriented program. JavaScript is more commonly used in web applications like browsers, while Java is more widely used in app development, smart devices and back-end applications.
