The Simple Assignment Operator (=) is used to assign values to variables.  

1. Arithmetic Operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and remainder (%). The addition operator can also be used for string concatenation.  

2. Unary Operators work on a single operand. The unary plus (+) indicates positivity, while the unary minus (-) negates a value. Increment (++) increases a value by 1, and decrement (--) decreases it by 1. The logical complement (!) inverts the value of a boolean.  

3. Equality and Relational Operators are used to compare values. Equality (==) checks if values are the same, while inequality (!=) checks if they are different. Relational operators include greater than (>), greater than or equal to (>=), less than (<), and less than or equal to (<=).  

4. Conditional Operators include logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and the ternary operator (?:), which acts as a shorthand for an if-then-else statement.  

5. The Type Comparison Operator (instanceof) checks whether an object is of a specific type.  

6. Finally, Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators perform operations at the binary level. These include the bitwise complement (~), signed left shift (<<), signed right shift (>>), and unsigned right shift (>>>). Bitwise operators also include AND (&), OR (|), and exclusive OR (^).
