How to create methods?
1. Say you want the output to be to print "Hello World" 2 times.

```
public class Methods{

    public static void main(String []args){
        void sayHelloWorldTwice(){
            System.out.println("Hello World");
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```
2. After declaring the method, you can use the `void` command and it the name of the set method, in this case `sayHelloWorldTwice`, and it would print the output as the one said inside the two curly brackets ( {} ).
